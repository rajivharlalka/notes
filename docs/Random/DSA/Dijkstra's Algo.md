- SSSP problems.
- find closest node reachable and then relax other node.
- use priority queue to handle 
- if total loop has negetive weightm then dijkstra fails.

## Problem
- City
- V nodes, E Edges
- There is a start node S, and there is a truck with c amount of fuel. 
- Each road has a length l and to traverse the road l fuel is needed.
- There are some fuel tanks in the city and a price `P[i]` needs to be paid
- Min cost path.


2.
- Graph with weight on edges.
