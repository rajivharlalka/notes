# Screen share in Wayland DM

While screen sharing in wayland window manager, the window gets shared accurately but with full screen share it's just the cursor with black screen. I while using my arch linux, encountered this, and the only solution found on browsers was to `enable` this flag `#enable-webrtc-pipewire-capturer`.

### On edge

- Go to `edge://flags/#enable-webrtc-pipewire-capturer` and enable it.

### On chrome

- Go to `chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-pipewire-capturer` and enable it.
