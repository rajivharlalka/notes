## Rajiv's Programming Notes

Hi, I am Rajiv Harlalka, scribbling all my thoughts here. 

It all starts with an Index and grows on slowly. The first node, the first md file is the motivation needed to start off with doing things.

I love to read and talk about things which excite and amaze me, be it about coffee brewing , understanding an interpreter to knowing how a guitar makes sound.

Recently I have been following the idea of 5 and would love to talk more incase interested.Can contact me over through:
