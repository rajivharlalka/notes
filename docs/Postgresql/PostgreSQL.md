### Progress Meter

#### base_backup
```sql
SELECT pid, phase,
100.0*((backup_streamed*1.0)/backup_total) AS "progress%"
FROM pg_stat_progress_basebackup;
```

#### COPY FROM % progress will be as follows:
```sql
SELECT (SELECT relname FROM pg_class WHERE oid = relid),
100.0*((bytes_processed*1.0)/bytes_total) AS "progress%"
FROM pg_stat_progress_copy;
```

#### COPY TO % progress will be as follows:
```sql
SELECT relname,
100.0*((tuples_processed*1.0)/(case reltuples WHEN 0 THEN 
10 WHEN -1 THEN 10 ELSE reltuples END)) AS "progress%"
FROM pg_stat_progress_copy JOIN pg_class on oid = relid;
```

Killing in-transaction sessions
```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
 FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'idle in transaction'
 AND current_timestamp â€“ state_change > '10 min';
```
